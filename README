Villanova won the NCAA men's basketball champion for the 2017-18 season. They also lost to 4 different teams earlier in the season.
By the definition for this program, these 4 teams are "transitive" champions. Also by this definition, any team that beat those 4 
teams are also transitive champions. This chain continues until there are no other teams that beat any teams that by some degree of
separation beat Villanova. 

This program tampers with the data over this past season to determine some key points over this concept. How many teams did not
transitively win? Did all division 1 schools transitively win?

The idea for this came about from a FiveThirtyEight challenge. Readers were prompted with this very hypothetical and asked to determine
a number.

The program was built in Visual Studio with C#. I utilized a tree of teams, organized by losses. Villanova was the root, and every team
they lost to was a child to them. This continues on with every team being added only once. From this data structure, we can determine
any sort of bit of information related to the original questions asked.
